    "transcript": " The birch canoe slid on the smooth planks. Glue the sheet to the dark blue background. It is easy to tell the depth of a well. These days a chicken leg is a rare dish. Rice is often served in round bowls. The juice of lemons makes fine punch. The box was thrown beside the parked truck. The hogs were fed chopped corn and garbage. Four hours of steady work faced us. A large size in stockings is hard to sell.",
    "translation": "木独木舟滑在光滑的板上. 贴纸贴在深蓝色的背景上. 很容易看出井的深度. 如今,腿是一种罕见的菜. 通常用圆碗. 汁很好打. 盒子被扔到停放的卡车旁边. 猪被碎的玉米和垃圾. 我们面临着四个小时的稳定的工作. 大尺度的子很难卖. 子的子很难卖. 子的子很难卖. 子的子很难吃. 子的子很难吃. 子的子很难吃. 子的子很难吃. 子的子很难吃. 子的子很难吃."
