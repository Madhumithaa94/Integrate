    "transcript": " The mute muffled the high tones of the horn. The gold ring fits only a pierced ear. The old pan was covered with hard fudge. Watch the log float in the wide river. The node on the stalk of wheat grew daily. The heap of fallen leaves was set on fire. Write fast if you want to finish early. His shirt was clean, but one button was gone. The barrel of beer was a brew of malt and hops. Tin cans are absent from store shelves.",
    "translation": "沉默沉默了喇的高音. 黄金戒指只适合穿孔的耳朵. 老被硬覆盖. 观看木头漂浮在广的河流中. 小麦茎上的节点每天都生长. 落叶堆被点燃. 如果你想早点完成的话,快点写. 他的衫干净了,但一个按消失了. 酒的桶是牛奶和菜的. 子不在商店的货架上."
